Homework 3



Type "make" to build the homework3.exe file.  Then, type "homework3.exe" to run the program.  
Input and output files will be created.  They are all named after their number of integers (256, 
512, 1024, etc...).

The program will automatically generate six input files, and will create outputs based on those 
files.  So, all resulting text files will be different every time the program is run.
